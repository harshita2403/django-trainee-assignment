## ðŸš€ Assignment 1: Django Signals

Django signals are executed **synchronously by default**, meaning they run in the **same thread and database transaction** as the caller.

### **Example Code**
```python
@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def my_signal_handler(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal received!")
    print(f"Thread: {threading.current_thread().name}")
